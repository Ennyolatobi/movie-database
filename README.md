# 🎬 Movie Database Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Movie Database web application that allows users to search for movies and view detailed information about them.

The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it fetches real movie data from a public API.

This project is part of my Front-End Capstone Project and was built from scratch during the capstone phase.
